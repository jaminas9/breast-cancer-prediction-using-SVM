# breast-cancer-prediction-using-SVM
In this project, I have used breast cancer dataset from Wisconsin. 
Project was done in Jupyter Notebook and Spyder.
The goal was to implement SVM from scratch, and this algorithm can be seen in SVM.py file.
The rest of analysis like Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Preparation and kernels as well as results can be seen in Jupyter Notebook file.
